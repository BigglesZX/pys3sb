h3. pyS3sb

pyS3sb is a Python rewrite of "s3sb":http://github.com/BigglesZX/s3sb, a basic shell script package to back up files and databases to Amazon S3.

Copy @config-sample.py@ to @config.py@ and tune the values as desired.

**Prerequisites:** @mysqldump@ and @gzip@; Python 2.7 (2.6 probably works fine, but has not been tested) and boto in your environment. If you have pip installed, run @pip install -r REQUIREMENTS@ in the pyS3sb directory to automagically install boto.

pyS3sb is designed to work in tandem with @cron@. Set up cron jobs to call @pys3sb@ with the @--daily@, @--weekly@ and @--monthly@ switches, something like this:

bc. 0 0 * * * cd /path/to/pys3sb; python s3sb.py --daily
0 0 * * 0 cd /path/to/pys3sb; python s3sb.py --weekly
0 0 1 * * cd /path/to/pys3sb; python s3sb.py --monthly

This will call pyS3sb at the appropriate times and run tasks according to their defined frequency in the config file. Depending on how your environment is set up, you may need to adjust your $PATH or invoke your .bashrc file, e.g:

bc. 0 0 * * * source ~/.bashrc; cd /path/to/pys3sb; python s3sb.py --daily

pyS3sb is a work in progress, so please stay tuned.
